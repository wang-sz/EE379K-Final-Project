  abstract =    "The Shodan computer search engine crawls the Internet attempting to identify any
                connected device. Using Shodan, researchers identified thousands of Internet-facing
                devices associated with industrial controls systems (ICS). This research examines the
                impact of Shodan on ICS security, evaluating Shodans ability to identify
                Internet-connected ICS devices and assess if targeted attacks occur as a result of Shodan
                identification. In addition, this research evaluates the ability to limit device exposure to
                Shodan through service banner manipulation. Shodans impact was evaluated by deploying
                four high-interaction, unsolicited honeypots over a 55 day period, each configured to
                represent Allen-Bradley programmable logic controllers (PLC). All four honeypots were
                successfully indexed and identifiable via the Shodan web interface in less than 19 days.
                Despite being indexed, there was no increased network activity or targeted ICS attacks.
                Although results indicate Shodan is an effective reconnaissance tool, results contrast
                claims of its use to broadly identify and target Internet-facing ICS devices. Additionally,
                the service banner for two PLCs were modified to evaluate the impact on Shodan indexing
                capabilities. Findings demonstrated service banner manipulation successfully limited
                device exposure from Shodan queries."

  abstract =    "The Shodan computer search engine has received significant attention due to its ability
                to identify and index Internet-facing industrial control system components. Industrial
                control systems are employed in numerous critical infrastructure assets, including oil
                and gas pipelines, water distribution systems, electrical power grids, nuclear plants
                and manufacturing facilities. The ability of malicious actors to identify industrial
                control devices that are accessible over the Internet is cause for alarm. Indeed, Shodan
                provides attackers with a powerful reconnaissance tool for targeting industrial control systems.

                This paper investigates the functionality of the Shodan computer search engine. In the experiments, four
                Allen-Bradley ControlLogix programmable logic controllers were deployed in an Internet-facing
                configuration to evaluate the indexing and querying capabilities of Shodan: all four
                programmable logic controllers were indexed and identified by Shodan within 19 days. This
                paper also describes a potential mitigation strategy that employs service banner manipulation
                to limit the exposure to Shodan queries."
