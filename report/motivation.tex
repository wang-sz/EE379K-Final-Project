% counter shall never be trusted once it gets marked as untrusted. Our shadow logic is more precise and recognizes that a trusted reset 
% guarantees a trusted $0$ in the counter value.}

% -rename section to: (eg, Ideology, Practical implications etc.) 
% - Think from an internal security compliance team perspective -- you want to make sure all your apps are upto the latest security standard so that a breach is not easy
% -Think from pen-test engineers/consultancies -- they want a nice and effective way to detect vulnerabilities in systems so that the client's purpose is solved and they gain reputation etc.

The number of devices connected to the Internet is growing exponentially, increasing
the chances that malicious actors will be able to find vulnerable Internet-connected devices.
These devices can expose a wide variety of remotely accessible services
and are easily identified through search engines, like Shodan, designed for IoT devices.
This poses as a privacy concern for many, since Shodan's scans can reveal a lot of
private information about a device.

We created a tool to scan the Internet
because it is useful in finding specific information pertaining to vulnerabilities in a device
that malicious actors could use to carry out an attack. The user is then able to 
take precautionary security steps to prevent any attackers from maliciously interfering
with the device's normal functionality, such as a Denial of Service attack or using it to
attack other devices on the same network that may be more secure to out of network attacks.
Thus, by performing regular scans on a specific subnet or even the whole Internet, a user
would able to keep up to date if any new devices connected to the network have similar
vulnerabilities.
