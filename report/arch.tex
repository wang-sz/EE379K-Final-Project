Since there are three different CVEs to look at, the methods used to scan
for devices vulnerable to those will be slightly different, both with
Shodan and our custom scanning tool.

For CVE-2014-2256, the vulnerability is described as an issue with Siemens
SIMATIC S7-1200 CPU PLC devices that have an older firmware that allows remote
attackers to execute a Denial of Service (DoS) attack\cite{CVE-2014-2256}. On Shodan, the exact
search term used to find these vulnerable devices is: \verb|siemens port:"102"|.
The DoS attack is caused by attackers sending ISO-TSAP, or TCP, packets to
specifically port 102, since this port is left open by the firmware. Then, for
the custom tool, we use \verb|zmap| to scan on port 102 and get a list of devices
probed, which could be longer than the list from Shodan, since there is no
filtering for the specific vulnerable devices we are looking for. Then, we filter
for devices by getting OS information from \verb|nmap| to determine the final
list of devices.

CVE-2019-0708 is described as a remote code execution vulnerability that
exists in Microsoft's Remote Desktop Protocol in Windows\cite{CVE-2019-0708}. In Shodan, we need
several searches for devices with port 3389 open and running versions of 
Windows that could potentially be vulnerable. This means our searches combines
the term \verb|port:"3389"| with one of the following: \verb|os:"Windows 7 or 8"|,
\verb|os:"Windows XP"|, \verb|2003|, or \verb|2008|. In this case, the last two
terms refer to versions of Windows Server. Our custom tool utilizes \verb|nmap|
to detect for an open port 3389 as well as the OS. Then the results are filtered
for the versions of Windows we are looking for.

Finally, CVE-2018-0101 is a vulnerability in Cisco's Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA)
Software, specifically the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) VPN functionality. This
vulnerability could allow remote execution of a code and is possible since
enabling the webvpn feature will cause an attempted double free on a region
of memory on the device. This is detectable by checking to see if the Cisco
ASA device has the webvpn feature enabled. The National Vulnerability Database
provides a list of specific devices affected by this vulnerability\cite{CVE-2018-0101}. In Shodan,
we use the search term \verb|"Set-Cookie: webvpn=;" ssl:"ASA Temporary"|,
since the ASA Software sets a the webvpn cookie. Using just the webvpn filter
may also capture other devices where some other web applications might have
set the cookie as well, but the ASA Temporary SSL certificate filter gives
a narrower set of search results of devices vulnerable to this CVE. Our custom
tool to scan for this vulnerability is a honeypot that detects exploitation
attempts by listening on port 443 and records the vulnerable IPs that it
detects.
