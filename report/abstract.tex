We scan the internet for vulernable devices, focusing on select
vulerabilities, using Shodan. Then, we analyze the data to see
what the detected machines have in common. Additionally, we create
our own scanner to scan the internet for machines vulernable to the
same vulnerabilities and compare the results to those of Shodan's
scan.
