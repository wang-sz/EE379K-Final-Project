Shodan is a popular search engine used to detect Internet-facing devices.
By using this tool, we are able to collect data from IPs across the
Internet, focusing on select vulnerabilities. In this paper, we will
discuss how Shodan is used to find numbers of machines on the Internet
that are vulnerable from chosen CVEs that are remotely detected. The data
is then analyzed to see what the detected machines have in common.
Afterwards, we create our own scanner to scan the Internet for vulnerable
machines on the same ports as those of the identified devices in the CVEs.
The results are then compared to those of Shodan's scan.
