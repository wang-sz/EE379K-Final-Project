Overall, the test results were decent, considering the bandwidth
limitations that we had for scanning the internet. In fact, the ratios
show that with a bit of luck, even if scanning the whole internet is not
possible, vulnerable devices in the IPs probed are not too hard to come
across. We did expect that there would be much less results from our
custom tool compared to Shodan, which is evident when looking at the
raw numbers from both port scanning and further filtering, like specifying
the device manufacturer or the device OS.
However, it is important to take note of the feasibility of writing a tool
to detect certain vulnerabilities. For example, given a much smaller
network rather than the whole internet, probing devices would not take
as long and our custom tool would be much faster. In other words, detection
of these vulnerabilities in one's own devices is not a big challenge
and a solution should be sought after quickly for such vulnerabilities.
Whether the solution is easy or difficult depends much more on the exact
vulnerability and what the solution is is a whole different problem.
