                 tool set, a suite of free, publicly available
                 simulation tools that offer both detailed and
                 high-performance simulation of modern microprocessors.
                 The new release offers more tools and capabilities,
                 precompiled binaries, cleaner interfaces, better
                 documentation, easier installation, improved
                 portability, and higher performance. This report
                 contains a complete description of the tool set,
                 including retrieval and installation instructions, a
                 description of how to use the tools, a description of
                 the target SimpleScalar architecture, and many details
                 about the internals of the tools and how to customize
                 them. With this guide, the tool set can be brought up
                 and generating results in under an hour (on supported
                 platforms).",

  abstract =     "Recent technological advances are such that the gap
                 between processor cycle times and memory cycle times is
                 growing. Techniques to reduce or tolerate large memory
                 latencies become essential for achieving high processor
                 utilization. In this dissertation, we propose and
                 evaluate data prefetching techniques that address the
                 data access penalty problems. First, we propose a
                 hardware-based data prefetching approach for reducing
                 memory latency. The basic idea of the prefetching
                 scheme is to keep track of data access patterns in a
                 reference prediction table (RPT) organized as an
                 instruction cache. It includes three variations of the
                 design of the RPT and associated logic: generic design,
                 a lookahead mechanism, and a correlated scheme. They
                 differ mostly on the timing of the prefetching. We
                 evaluate the three schemes by simulating them in a
                 uniprocessor environment using the ten SPEC benchmarks.
                 The results show that the prefetching scheme
                 effectively eliminates a major portion of data access
                 penalty and is particularly suitable to an on-chip
                 design and a primary-secondary cache hierarchy. Next,
                 we study and compare the substantive performance gains
                 that could be achieved with hardware-controlled and
                 software-directed prefetching on shared-memory
                 multiprocessors. Simulation results indicate that both
                 hardware and software schemes can handle programs with
                 regular access patterns. The hardware scheme is good at
                 manipulating dynamic information, whereas software
                 prefetching has the flexibility of prefetching larger
                 blocks of data and of dealing with complex data access
                 patterns. The execution overhead of the additional
                 prefetching instructions may decrease the software
                 prefetching performance gains. An approach that
                 combines software and hardware schemes is shown to be
                 very promising for reducing the memory latency with the
                 least overhead. Finally, we study non-blocking caches
                 that can tolerate read and write miss penalties by
                 exploiting the overlap between post-miss computations
                 and data accesses. We show that hardware data
                 prefetching caches generally outperform non-blocking
                 caches. We derive a static instruction scheduling
                 algorithm to order instructions at compile time. The
                 algorithm is shown to be effective in exploiting
                 instruction parallelism available in a basic block for
                 non-blocking loads.",

  ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a type-based information flow
    analysis for a call-by-value $\lambda$-calculus equip\-ped with
    references, exceptions and $let$-polymorphism, which we refer to
    as ML. The type system is constraint-based and has decidable type
    inference. Its noninterference proof is reasonably light-weight,
    thanks to the use of a number of orthogonal techniques. First, a
    syntactic segregation between \emph{values} and \emph{expressions}
    allows a lighter formulation of the type system. Second,
    noninterference is reduced to \emph{subject reduction} for a
    nonstandard language extension. Lastly, a \emph{semi-syntactic}
    approach to type soundness allows dealing with constraint-based
    polymorphism separately.}
