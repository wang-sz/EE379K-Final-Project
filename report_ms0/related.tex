% The general problem of determining whether information flows in a program from
% variable $x$ to variable $y$ is undecidable, as ``any procedure purported to
% decide it could be applied to the statement {\bf if}~$f(x)$~halts {\bf then}~$y
% := 0$ and thus provide a solution to the halting problem for arbitrary
% recursive function''~\cite{denning-impossible}.  

In "Impact of the Shodan Computer Search Engine on Internet-facing Industrial
Control System Devices"\cite{afit//CSAR-10-025-01}, they discuss metrics
on whether or not Shodan has been and is being used to target industrial control
system devices. This addresses the concern of whether this method and channel of
attack are widely used when targetting a specific set of devices.

In another paper, "Evaluation of the ability of the Shodan search engine to
identify Internet-facing industrial control devices"\cite{bodenheim_shodan_ics},
they analyze Shodan's detection ability on a specific programmable logic controller
and suggests a potential solution to mitigate its visibility to Shodan.

In "Shodan Visualized"\cite{shodan_vis}, the paper discusses how Shodan actually
scans the internet.

In "Contactless Vulnerability Analysis using Google and Shodan"\cite{google_shodan},
the paper discusses combining Google searches and Shodan searches to determine
the vulnerability of systems in large scale networks.
