
Point out other important approaches in the problem area. For example, if you 
are proposing an architecture, maybe OS or PL approaches to this problem. 

The following paragraph included just for a figure. The caption of a figure is very
important -- I try to tell the entire story in the figures and captions alone, 
just in case that is all the reader sees.

The general problem of determining whether information flows in a program from
variable $x$ to variable $y$ is undecidable, as ``any procedure purported to
decide it could be applied to the statement {\bf if}~$f(x)$~halts {\bf then}~$y
:= 0$ and thus provide a solution to the halting problem for arbitrary
recursive function''~\cite{denning-impossible}.
